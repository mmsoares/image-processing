##### Task 1
Write a program which reads a JPEG image file and rewrites it with a different name.

This simple task has the goal of getting you acquainted with the usage of libraries for reading and writing files.

Test your program with the sample images which are available for this assignment. After doing it, check the size differences between the original images and the files you've created.
Do you notice any visual difference between the images? Any changes in the file sizes?

In case there are differences in the file sizes, do a little research on the web regarding JPEG files and try to explain the differences noticed.
